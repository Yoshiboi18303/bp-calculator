# Package Introduction

Using the Apex Battle Pass Calculator as an npm package is better used in a package that utilizes this, rather than for personal use due to needing to learn about how JavaScript works and how to code with it.

We'll talk about how to do it here.

## Prerequisites

- [**Node.js v16 or higher**](https://nodejs.org/)

- Basic JavaScript knowledge, not required, but **HIGHLY** recommended.

:::info

Why is Basic JavaScript knowledge recommended? There's a pretty good reason for that.

As you code with JavaScript, errors will occur every now and then, if you don't have JavaScript knowledge, you may not understand what the error message means, and might get a little frustrated with it.

**We don't want that, programming is supposed to be fun!**

You can learn JavaScript in many ways, I'll give you some links.
